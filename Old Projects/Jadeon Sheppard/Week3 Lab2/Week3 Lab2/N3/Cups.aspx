            A cup is a small open container used for drinking and carrying drinks.[1][2] It can be made of wood, plastic, glass, clay, metal, stone, china or other materials,[3] and it might have a stem, handles or other adornments. Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes,[4] and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations.[5]

            Cups have been used for thousands of years for the purpose of carrying food and drink, as well as for decoration.[6] They are used in certain cultural rituals and to hold objects not intended for drinking such as coins.
